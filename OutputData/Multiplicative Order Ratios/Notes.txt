N = 2

Val = Count(0(Mod 2))/All

Lower = 0.5
Upper = 0.69

Mean = 0.666 ~ 2/3

Higher outliers: num = (2*a*a) for all integers a
Lower outliers: num = (a*a) for all integers a

0.4 to 0.5: num = 4*(a^4)
< 0.25: num = a^4

When plotting out values on a 2-D Excel thing (ModN = 2 case), it is evident that the
0's between the 1's and vice versa are always powers of 2. Even with the spaces of
non-coprimes in between.
